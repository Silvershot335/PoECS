  <p>PoECheatSheet is a personal project in which I am learning HTML and CSS. The goal of this project
    is to create a working website that can be used by other people (namely friends).

    <br>

    PoECheatSheet's goal as a website is to provide a consolidated source of information for Path of Exile players.
    The goal is not to provide a learning environment or a beginners guide, but a one-stop-shop for all of your
    on-the-fly references. A way to use a single link to have a veriety of cheatsheets and references available to
    you during your gameplay. Otherwise, all of this information is out there, but spread far and wide accross the
    internet.
    <br>

    If you have any development ideas, reference ideas, or would like to contribute- please contact me or use the
    Help Me button on the navbar and join the Discord.
